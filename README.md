# SQL Query Operations – Sports Registration Database 🏀⚽🎾

This project contains a set of structured query language (SQL) operations performed on a mock sports registration database. The goal is to demonstrate basic-to-intermediate SQL proficiency through SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE operations, and visualize the relational structure with an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram.

## Project Summary

The dataset simulates a sports registration system, including tables for **Parents**, **Players**, **Coaches**, **Teams**, and **Colors**.

###  SQL Tasks Performed:
1. **Retrieve Data** – Selected full names and addresses from the `Parent` table.
2. **Join Tables** – Combined `Player` and `Registers` to show players with their corresponding parent IDs.
3. **Update Data** – Modified a coach's name and verified the changes.
4. **Insert Records** – Added two new teams using a single SQL statement.
5. **Delete Records** – Removed specific color entries based on their IDs.
